\section*{Description}
We translated the original proposal into mysql tables, with each object and
relation corresponding to a table and each attribute corresponding the an
attribute in the table.


The following are checks that we added by table:


\begin{verbatim}
    address: check that the length of the zipcode >= 5
        check that the street number is a positive int.
    All U.S. zipcodes are at least five characters long and there are no
    negative or zero street numbers.

    cart: check that the price is a positive number.
    We are not going to allow negative prices, so aggregate prices cannot be negative.

    person: check that the first name and last name aren't the empty strings
        check that the password isn't the empty string and that the length is
        greater than 5.  We need the user's full first and last name, and so we
        will not accept the
    empty string for either.  For security reasons, that password cannot be the
    empty string or have a length less than or equal to five.

    category: check that the name and description aren't the empty string.
    The categories must have a name and a description.

    item: check that the name isn't the empty string
        check that the price is a positive number and that the quantity isn't a
        negative number.  The item must have a name. Since prices cannot be
        negative, it must also have a non-negative price.
    Since the user cannot buy something we don't have, the quantity cannot be
    less than zero.

    review: check that the rating is between 1 and 5, inclusive
        check that the description isn't the empty string.
    The rating will be between a one and a five, inclusive, and there must be
    some reason given for the rating.
\end{verbatim}


Additionally, we checked to make sure that none of the fields were NULL.
Although most MySQL tables not check this constraint on every single attribute,
we thought that our tables were concise enough that we should do so. For
example, in the 'item' tables, we have the following fields: id, name,
description, price, seller\_id, quantity, and category\_id. Removing primary and
foreign keys, we are left with name, description, price, and quantity. None of
these attributes should be NULL (with the exception of possibly the
description, but we thought that all items should definitely have a
description). Doing a similar analysis, we came to a similar conclusion for all
of our tables.  \end{document}
